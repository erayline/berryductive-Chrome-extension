I made this extension and upload it to chrome extension market to use.

What does it do? 
-> I always find myself doomscrolling in youtube homepage. So I decided to block this. 
-> This extension removes suggestions, channel pages, etc.
-> only videos that you search are shown. This gives you a purpuses.
